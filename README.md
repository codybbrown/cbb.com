This work-in-progress site will eventually replace my current personal site as my web development skill grows.  

Once this one is pumping, I will create a new, actual portfolio site with all the projects.

current personal website:
www.codybbrown.com

That one has all my arts and musics.  Actually only a tiny percent of them, and none of my programming.
